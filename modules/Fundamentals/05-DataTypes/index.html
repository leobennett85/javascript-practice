    <p>
      Javascript is Dynamically typed meaning its storage types can be anything
      at anytime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s practically no
      difference between them in JavaScript. Backticks are “extended
      functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions
      into a string by wrapping them in ${…}, for example:
    </p>
    <p>Booleans are binary. isGreater is true is 4 > 1.</p>
    <p>
      A null is assigned to empty variables that may need to be initiated later.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a variable is declared but never initiated it is "Undefined".
      Initiating the variable with a null is a better practice.
    </p>
    <p>The typeof operator returns the DataType of the object.</p>
